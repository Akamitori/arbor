arbor
---
arbor is a behavior tree implementation in C#. It is entirely experimental and is not intended for anyone's use except my own. I do not recommend using it.

If you're desperately looking for a good C# behavior tree, and you think this might be it, feel free to ask me how stable it is; it may be better than it was when I wrote this README. Note that a lack of development may mean it's dead and abandoned, or may simply mean I'm happy with it and it works well.
